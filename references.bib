abstract = {Abstract A central challenge in ecology is understanding the emergence of patterns as the result of interactions among individuals. Dynamic forest models can provide a fine-scale description of the ecological, physiological and environmental processes that explain the demography of coexisting tree species. This in turn helps predict changes under future scenarios. However, model accessibility is a major obstacle to a wide use and communication across scientific disciplines and for educational purposes. Here, we present the R package rcontroll, which provides access to the TROLL forest simulator in the R environment. TROLL is individual-based and spatially explicit and leverages knowledge of ecology, biogeochemistry and tree ecophysiology through a trait-based parameterisation. TROLL has been used to simulate carbon fluxes and tree diversity in tropical and subtropical forests and to explore forest resilience to disturbance and environmental changes more generally. rcontroll provides a user-friendly environment to set up and analyse TROLL simulations with varying community compositions, ecological parameters and climate conditions. We show how to test parameter sensitivity in TROLL using the rcontroll R package. We also demonstrate the flexibility and ease of use of rcontroll by replicating a previously published study based on the TROLL simulator. Both examples are included with reproducible code documents. Complex forest simulators are important scientific tools for science and education, and wide access to these tools is an important condition for their adoption. TROLL is designed to address a wide range of ecological and environmental questions, and the new R package rcontroll is designed to be an entry point for TROLL model users.},

   abstract = {Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual- based and spatially explicit forest growth simulator, TROLL, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction, and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest.We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we vali- dated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500 years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural character- istics similar to observations (e.g., leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model’s sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coeffi- cient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. TROLL should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.},
